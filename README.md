# 💼 Customer Churn Prediction & Analysis

![Churn Banner](./banner.png)

## 🚀 Overview

This project analyzes and predicts **customer churn** using a real-world Telco dataset. We explore key factors influencing churn, build predictive models, and create an interactive **Streamlit web app** for churn risk scoring.  

🎯 **Business Goal**: Identify customers likely to leave and suggest actionable strategies to improve retention.
